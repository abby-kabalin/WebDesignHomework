            <h3>Summary: Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction,
                stealing
                valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at
                its
                most
                vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of
                corporate
                espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has
                ever
                loved.
                Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but
                only
                if
                he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of
                specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one.
                If
                they
                succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can
                prepare
                the
                team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb
                could
                have
                seen coming.<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/plotsummary/?ref_=tt_stry_pl">â€”Warner

            <h3>Review: I recently rewatched Inception on a Sunday and I remembered how much I loved this movie.
                I first watched this
                movie my Freshman year of college when I was deathly ill. I had stayed at my grandparents house
                in Lolo because I was
                stuck in my dorm with no cold meds. They were out of town so I crashed on the downstairs couch
                and watched Inception and
                Notorious Basterds. What really stuck out to me was the unique concept and plot line. Breaking
                into a mind for information
                instead of a bank or intelligence agency was a brilliant idea and the exectution was
                well-rounded. The ambiguous ending really
                had me thinking and in my opinion, he was still in Limbo when the screen went black. As far as
                casting and special effects go, this
                movie really outdid itself. I've watched Marvel movies with double Inception's $160 million
                budget and they don't even come close to the
                quality of the SFX. I love movies that I can just be in awe of the SFX instead of thinking "woah
                there's the SFX". Special effects should
                enhance immersion, not pull the watcher out of it. Casting was spot on as well, kudos to <a
                    href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14776261/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr">Luise Eigner</a> & <a
                    href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0660667/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr">John Papsidera</a>, I really
                couldn't imagine the movie without Leonardo, Joseph, Elliot, Tom or Cillian. Also as a side
                note, absolute props to Joseph and Tom. Their chemistry was amazing and even though they had few
                interactions, they showed that
                they had previously worked together and seemed to be friends before /something/ happened. It's
                not often that you get standalone
                stories that the ability to make you question what happened without explicitly stating or
                showing a flashback. These two and Leo's character
                perfectly encapsulated the idea of "show, don't tell". I could go on and on about this movie but
                I'll leave it at this: Inception is a masterclass in
                storytelling, casting, and special effects. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a
                good thriller or a movie that makes you think. I personally love movies and shows that leave you
                googling
                after the credits role. Inception is a movie that will have you thinking about it for days after
                you watch it. </h3>
