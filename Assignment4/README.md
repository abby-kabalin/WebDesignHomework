### How Web Browsers function
A web browser is a software program used to access the internet from a device. It can read languages like HTML, CSS, and JS to render text, graphics, and other content.

### DOM
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

### Difference btw HTML, XML, and XHMTL
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the language in which web pages are formulated.
