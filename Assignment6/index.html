    <p>An essay is a common type of academic writing that you'll likely be asked to do in multiple classes. Before
        you
        start writing your essay, make sure you understand the details of the assignment so that you know how to
        approach
        the essay and what your focus should be. Once you've chosen a topic, do some research and narrow down the
        main
        argument(s) you'd like to make. From there, you'll need to write an outline and flesh out your essay, which
        should
        consist of an introduction, body, and conclusion. After your essay is drafted, spend some time revising it
        to
        ensure your writing is as strong as possible.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the assignment</li>
        <li>Choose a topic</li>
        <li>Research the topic</li>
        <li>Write an outline</li>
        <li>Write your essay</li>
        <li>Revise your essay</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>Understand the Assignment</h3>
    <p>Before you start writing your essay, make sure you understand the details of the assignment so that you know
        how to approach the essay and what your focus should be.</p>

    <h3>Choose a Topic</h3>
    <p>Once you've understood the assignment, you'll need to choose a topic for your essay. Your topic should be
        broad or common enough that most people will know at least something about what you're discussing.</p>

    <h3>Research the Topic</h3>
    <p>Once you have chosen a topic, do some research and narrow down the main argument(s) you'd like to make.</p>

    <h3>Write an Outline</h3>
    <p>Once you have done your research and chosen your topic, you may need to do some brainstorming to come up with
        ideas for your essay. You should write an outline so that you can organize your thoughts and ideas before you
        begin writing the actual essay.</p>

    <h3>Write Your Essay</h3>
    <p>Once you have an outline, it's time to start writing. Write based on the outline itself, fleshing out your
        basic skeleton to create a whole, cohesive and clear essay.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <p>The introduction is the first paragraph of your essay. It should grab the reader's attention and provide some
            background information on the topic.</p>
        <li>Thesis Statement</li>
        <p>The thesis statement is a clear and concise statement that presents the main argument or point of your essay.
        </p>
        <li>Body Paragraphs</li>
        <p>The body paragraphs of your essay should provide supporting evidence and arguments for your thesis statement.
            Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or point.</p>
        <li>Conclusion</li>
        <p>The conclusion is the final paragraph of your essay. It should summarize your main points and restate your
            thesis
            statement.</p>
        <li>References</li>
        <p>If you have used any external sources in your essay, make sure to include a list of references or works
            cited.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Revise Your Essay</h3>
    <p>After your essay is drafted, spend some time revising it to ensure your writing is as strong as possible.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the structure of your essay</li>
        <li>Check the content of your essay</li>
        <li>Check the style of your essay</li>
    </ul>
